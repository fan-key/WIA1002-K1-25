My name is XXXX with matrix number, XXXX. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling thrilled about taking this subject. This is because this subject covers a lot of important concepts in programming. I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will study 10x harder than before. Wish me luck!!!
